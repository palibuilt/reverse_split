# reverse_split
This is a calculator for the value of one's holdings in AMC stock before and after a reverse split

Goal of this project: 
Calculate reverse split possible outcomes 
Account for the re-merger of AMC and APE
Simplify this issue that is dividing an entire investment community
Determine if Adam Aron is for retail or against (more of an abstract and opinion based determination for each investor to decide on their own) 
Continue to build stock market calculators to help investors determine, understand and simplify their decision making based on quantifiable results
